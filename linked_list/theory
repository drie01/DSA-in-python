Linked List — Theory Summary

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored non-contiguously in memory.
Each node contains:
Data — the actual value
Reference (link) — the address of the next node (pointer)

The list starts with a head node, and the last node points to null.

Why Linked Lists Exist
Arrays are great, but they have limits:
1.Fixed size
2.Costly insertions and deletions

Linked lists solve this by:
1.Allowing dynamic size
2.Making insertions and deletions easier (no shifting needed)
